# Javscript Learning 
- This repository contains my coding practise while learning javascript. 
- The scheduled practise was made for 15 days.
- It was a 15 days challenge to learn and start working in javascript.
- All the learing is divided in 2 hours for a day.

# Steps
- Following [w3 school javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp) Tutorial. 
- It has 100 lessons important regarding javascript. As you can count from the sidebar.
- We have 15 total days.
- Considering 100 lessons so 100/15 = 6.666
- I have two hours for a day means 120 minutes
- So Time for one lesson in minutes = 120minutes/6.66 lessons = 18 minutes
- This means I have to cover one lesson in 18 minutes.
- Thats the way I have planned to cover 100 lessons in 15 days giving 2 hours each day so that javascript will be learned this way.

# Way of learning:
- Remember you have only 18 minute for each lesson.
- Just read the content on in the lesson. By lesson I mean the sidebar items present in the w3 school javascript page.
- Just focus and implement and test the code where ever it is present rest content just read it out.
- It will not take 18 minutes even for 1 lesson.
- Now dont memorize. 
- Just save your commit after each lesson done means after every 18 minute the 20th minute will be when you should commit what you have learned means a lesson.
- Dont forget to comment out each line when you code.
- Also dont copy the code always write your own even if its just by looking at the code when you are getting started.

## Day 1
- Without thinking any thing just follow.
- Create A Github Repo named: "Javascript learning".
- Give it a name : "Javascript Learning".
- Clone it and start working
- It will take 3 minutes approx.
- Without thinking of any difficulties or challenges just open VS code in the directory downloaded or cloned i.e the repsository directory.
- Create a new folder named : Day 1 
- Create a file named lesson 1:
- Start coding.
- ðŸ™‚ Happy learning.
